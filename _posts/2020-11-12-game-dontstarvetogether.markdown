### Don't starve together 

I bought the app on iPhone, steam.

But play it on iPhone is totally unconvenierce.

I played in MacOS, but the experience is not so well to especially when I play with my sister in a server privte built.(We bought a server that provide the service of multi-player online on Taobal._:)

After about 2 monnth I just addicted to watching videos on Bilibili.com and reading books.

May I will play it some again someday.

Game is charming,

I what to explore more :)



These are the  screenshots captured our player in the game.
