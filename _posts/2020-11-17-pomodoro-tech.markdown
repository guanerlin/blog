title: "pomodoro technique"

Pomodoro technique is developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s.
`Pomodoro` means `tomato` in Italian.

The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, seperated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro (after the 
tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university student)

### The original technique inclueds six steps:

```
- 1.Decide on the task to be done.

- 2.Set the pomodoro timer(traditionally to 25 minutes)

- 3.Work on the task.

- 4.End work when the timer rings and put a checkmark on a peice of paper.

- 5.If you have fewer than four checkmarks, take a short break(3-5 minutes) and then return to step 2; otherwise continue to step 6.

- 6.After four pomodoros, take a longer break(15-30minutes), reset your checkmark count to zero, then go to step 1.
```
