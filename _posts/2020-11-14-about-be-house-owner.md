Last month, owned my first house in the city where holds my college, the city that I worked 9 years and lived nearly 13 years.

I borrowed some money that makes me feel a litter stress now.

By the way, I rent the house out and tried to be a proper 'landlord'.

The most exciting and interesting thing is I finally have a home in the city where I live, struggle, work, love, learn to grow up.

There is long way to go.

Wish me good luck.

Last month, I finally purchased my first house in the city where I attended college, the same city where I have worked for 9 years and lived for nearly 13 years.

I took out a loan, which is causing me a little stress at the moment.

By the way, I decided to rent the house out and try my hand at being a proper landlord.

The most exciting and interesting thing is that I now have a place to call home in the city where I have lived, struggled, worked, loved, and learned to grow.

There is still a long way to go.

Wish me good luck!
