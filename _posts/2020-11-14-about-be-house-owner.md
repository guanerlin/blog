Last month, owned my first house in the city where holds my college, the city that I worked 9 years and lived nearly 13 years.

I borrowed some money that makes me feel a litter stress now.

By the way, I rent the house out and tried to be a proper 'landlord'.

The most exciting and insteresting thing is I finnally have a home in the city where I live, struggle, work, love, learn to grow up.

There is long way to go.

Wish me good luck.
