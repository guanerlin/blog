First, I built this blog as some day in November 2020 I found one bloger from Korea.[https://dorbae.github.io/]

It built on GitHub pages which I tried once 2016 with a single index page.

So that's the beginning of this journey.

Below is the blog links I want to refer someday.

Like the themes, some layouts or comment feature.

I want my site be stable and more precise someday. Fighting!!!



Next goal:

1.add comment function 

2.change themes

3.use more layout frame
