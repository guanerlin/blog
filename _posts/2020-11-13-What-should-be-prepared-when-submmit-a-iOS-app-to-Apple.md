Latelly, I developed a children learning app in iOS.

It's a startup started by my collegue mates.

After two months' developing which is not a pleasant trip, 

the app is going to be shipped to App Store.

Wow,

I should send some meta infos as a to-do list to he project manager.So that's the whole story why I write  this post. *_ * 



First of all,

1.App descriptions

2.App keywords

3.App Screenshots 

4.Private and policy links

5.Testing user account to login the app
