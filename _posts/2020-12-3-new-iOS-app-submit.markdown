Today, the treector app has been approved by App Store and I released it with happy smile on my face.

I thought the submitting and review should last for days and nights as Apple is always strict with the new submiting app.

The first submit of this app is at 2020-11-29, then got a reject at 2020-12-1 with the iAP bug.Meanwhile Apple needs our iAP products' detail description and double sure about the price. Maybe because the product's price is too high.
I fixed the bug and add some description in Resolution Center and resubmitted the app at 2020-12-2.

Finally the app got approved today.

So happy and so greatful about this submit.
