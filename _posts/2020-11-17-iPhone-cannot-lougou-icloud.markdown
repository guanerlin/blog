## Cannot logout the iCloud account from my iPhoneSE yesterday.

I have tried many suggestions:
reconnect wifi
use a cellular network
set Date setting to auto match your time zone
erase the data and the network setting of my devices
etc.

Finally the solution is :

It turns out my iPhoneSE set the netorking of the Setting app to None.
Neither cellular data nor WLAN network accessory authorize to the Setting app.
So Setting->Wifi->Setting App->WLAN&Cellular Data
